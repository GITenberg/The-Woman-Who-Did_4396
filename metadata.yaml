description: "The Woman Who Did (1895) is a novel by Grant Allen about a young, self-assured\
  \ middle-class woman who defies convention as a matter of principle and who is fully\
  \ prepared to suffer the consequences of her actions. It was first published in\
  \ London by John Lane in a series intended to promote the ideal of the \"New Woman\"\
  . It was adapted into a British silent film in 1915, The Woman Who Did, which was\
  \ directed by Walter West, and later into a 1925 German film, Die Frau mit dem schlechten\
  \ Ruf.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
